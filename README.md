Objective:
Create a full-stack e-commerce application that allows users to browse products, add items to a cart, place orders, and manage their profiles.
Duration: 25 days
Note: No need to do frontend, we need only backend as per the given requirements!

Task Description
Day 1-2: Requirement Analysis
- Understand Requirements:
  - Identify the core features and functionalities needed for the e-commerce application (e.g., product listing, user authentication, order management).
- Define API Endpoints:
  - List the endpoints required for product management, user authentication, and order processing (e.g., `/products`, `/orders`, `/users`).

Day 3-5: Database Design
- Design Schema:
  - Create a database schema to store user information, product details, and order history.
  - Example Tables:
    - `users`: id, username, password, email, address
    - `products`: id, name, description, price, stock, created_at, updated_at
    - `orders`: id, user_id, total_amount, status, created_at, updated_at
    - `order_items`: id, order_id, product_id, quantity, price
- Setup Database:
  - Configure the database using PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB.
  - Create necessary tables and relationships.

Day 6-10: Backend API Development
- Set up Environment:
  - Configure the backend environment with necessary tools and frameworks.
- Implement Product Management Endpoints:
  - List Products: `GET /products`
  - View Single Product: `GET /products/{id}`
  - Add Product (Admin only): `POST /products`
  - Update Product (Admin only): `PUT /products/{id}`
  - Delete Product (Admin only): `DELETE /products/{id}`
- Implement User Management Endpoints:
  - User Registration: `POST /register`
  - User Login: `POST /login`
  - View Profile: `GET /users/{id}`
  - Update Profile: `PUT /users/{id}`
- Implement Order Management Endpoints:
  - Place Order: `POST /orders`
  - View Order History: `GET /orders`
  - View Single Order: `GET /orders/{id}`
  - Cancel Order: `DELETE /orders/{id}`
- Validation and Error Handling:
  - Implement input validation and error handling for all endpoints.

Day 11-13: Frontend Development
- Set up Frontend Environment:
  - Configure the frontend environment using React.js, Angular, or Vue.js.
- Create User Interfaces:
  - Home Page: Display product listings with options to filter and search.
  - Product Page: Show detailed information about a single product.
  - Cart Page: Display items added to the cart with options to update quantities or remove items.
  - Checkout Page: Collect user information and confirm the order.
  - Profile Page: Allow users to view and update their profiles.
- Integrate Frontend with Backend:
  - Use Axios, Fetch API, or similar libraries to connect the frontend with the backend API.
Day 14-16: User Authentication and Authorization
- Implement Authentication:
  - Use JWT for user authentication.
  - Ensure users can register, log in, and access their profiles.
- Role-Based Access Control:
  - Restrict product management endpoints to admin users only.
  - Ensure only authenticated users can place orders.

Day 17-19: Testing
- Backend Testing:
  - Write unit tests for each backend endpoint to ensure they function correctly.
- Frontend Testing:
  - Test frontend components to ensure they interact correctly with the backend API.
- Integration Testing:
  - Perform integration testing to verify the interaction between the frontend and backend.

Day 20-21: Documentation (Optional)
- API Documentation:
  - Use Swagger or Postman to document the backend API endpoints, including request and response formats.
- User Guide:
  - Write a brief guide on how to use the application, including screenshots and example flows.
- Technical Documentation:
  - Document the database schema, code structure, and any important configurations.

Day 22-23: Review and Refactor
- Code Review:
  - Review the entire codebase to identify any potential improvements or optimizations.
- Refactoring:
  - Refactor both frontend and backend code to enhance performance, readability, and maintainability.

Day 24-25: Deployment and Submission
- Final Commit and Push:
  - Commit the final version of the code to a GitHub repository.
- Submit GitHub Link:
  - Submit the GitHub repository link along with the deployed application URL in the task submission form.

Deliverables:
- Fully functional full-stack e-commerce application.
- Database schema and setup scripts.
- Comprehensive API and user documentation.
- Unit and integration test cases.
- GitHub repository with the final code.
- Deployed application link.

Tools and Technologies:
- Backend: Node.js (Express)/Python (Flask/Django)/Java (Spring Boot)
- Frontend: React.js/Angular/Vue.js
- Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB
